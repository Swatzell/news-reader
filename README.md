## Learning Goals:

The goal of this project was to showcase my knowledge and abilities working with React ,React Router ,Asynchronous JavaScript and End to end testing with Cypress and to get practice with something similar to an "Interview Challenge" that might be provided during a job interview.

## Wins + Challenges:

A big win for me was just seeing that I can now knock out a simple app like this quickly and confidently.
